# hello-world
Beginning my coding journey
I have studied languages, travelled the world, got marriedd, had children and studied BCom Business Informatics.
Now I am on my coding journey, spending hours learning how to code while I am a English teacher.
I love databases and analysing information but I also love the fact that I can build amazing software with apps.
